Forward invoices directly from your email to VATextract for automatic processing—no manual uploads required.

## Your Personal Inbox

Every VATextract account includes a unique email address for invoice forwarding:

```
...@vat-extract.com
```

Find your personal address in **Settings → Email Forwarding**.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive an Invoice">
    An invoice lands in your regular work email.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Forward It">
    Forward the email to your VATextract inbox address. You can find it on the dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Processing">
    VATextract extracts the PDF attachment and processes it immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Results">
    The extracted invoice appears in your dashboard within seconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Attachment Types

| Type | Supported |
|------|-----------|
| PDF attachments | ✓ |
| Image attachments (JPEG, PNG) | ✓ |
| Multiple attachments | ✓ (processed as separate invoices) |

<Info>
  If multiple PDF attachments are included in one email, each is processed as a separate invoice.

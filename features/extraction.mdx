## Extraction Confidence

Each extracted field includes a confidence score (0-100%). Low-confidence extractions are highlighted in the review interface for manual verification.

## Geometry Data

For advanced integrations, VATextractprovides bounding box coordinates for each extracted field:

```json
{
  "fieldName": "TOTAL",
  "text": "$1,250.00",
  "confidence": 98.5,
  "geometry": {
    "boundingBox": {
      "left": 0.72,
      "top": 0.85,
      "width": 0.15,
      "height": 0.02
    },
    "pageNumber": 1
  }
}
```

This enables document overlay highlighting and programmatic field location.

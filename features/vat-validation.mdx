description: "Automatic EU and UK VAT number verification"
---

VATextract automatically validates supplier VAT numbers against official EU VIES and UK HMRC databases.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Extraction">
    When an invoice is processed, the supplier's VAT/Tax ID is extracted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    The VAT number is checked against the appropriate government database (EU VIES or UK HMRC).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Matching">
    The registered company name and address are compared with the invoice data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Validation Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `VALID` | VAT number is registered and active |
| `INVALID` | VAT number not found or inactive |
| `PENDING` | Validation in progress |
| `NOT_FOUND` | No VAT number detected on invoice |
| `ERROR` | Validation service temporarily unavailable |

## Match Quality

Beyond validating the VAT number, VATextract compares the registered company details with the invoice:

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `EXACT` | Company name matches the VAT registry exactly |
| `CLOSE` | Minor differences (e.g., "Ltd" vs "Limited") |
| `NO_MATCH` | Significant discrepancy—may indicate fraud |

<Warning>
  A `NO_MATCH` result doesn't necessarily indicate fraud. Company names on invoices often differ from official registry entries. Always review manually before rejecting.
</Warning>

Each validated VAT number includes:

```json

  "vatValidationStatus": "VALID",
  "vatMatchQuality": "EXACT",
  "vatValidatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "vatValidationData": {

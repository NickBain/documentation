## Exporting to Google Sheets

### Automatic Sync

- Updates sync when invoice data is modified

## Sheet Structure

VATextractcreates a structured spreadsheet:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A: Invoice Number | Unique identifier |
| B: Date | Invoice date |
| C: Supplier | Company name |
| D: Net Amount | Pre-tax total |
| E: VAT | Tax amount |

<Info>
  Column headers are automatically created on first export. You can rename columns without breaking the sync.

## Sharing & Collaboration

Your connected Google Sheet can be shared with team members:

1. Open the spreadsheet in Google Sheets
2. Click **Share** in the top right
3. Add collaborators with view or edit access

Changes made by collaborators in Google Sheets do not sync back to VATextract.

## Permissions

VATextractrequests the following Google permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |

| See your primary email | Identify your account |

<Warning>
  We never access your other Google Drive files or Gmail.

## Troubleshooting

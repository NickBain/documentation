## Field Mapping

Map VATextract fields to your Airtable columns:

| VATextractField | Recommended Airtable Type |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Supplier Name | Single line text |
| Invoice Number | Single line text |
| Invoice Date | Date |
| Due Date | Date |
| Total Amount | Currency |
| VAT Amount | Currency |
| Currency | Single select |
| Status | Single select |

### Custom Fields

You can map any extracted field to any Airtable column. The integration supports:

- Text fields → Single/Long text
- Numbers → Number/Currency
- Dates → Date
- Arrays (line items) → Linked records

## Syncing Invoices

### Manual Sync

1. Select invoices in your dashboard
2. Click **Bulk Actions → Push to Airtable**
3. Invoices are synced to your connected base

### Automatic Sync

Enable auto-sync in **Settings → Integrations → Airtable**:

- **On upload**: Sync immediately when an invoice is processed
- **On approval**: Sync only when review status is "Approved"

## Handling Line Items

Line items can be synced in two ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JSON Field">
    Store all line items as a JSON string in a Long text field.
    
    ```json
    [
      {"description": "Widget A", "quantity": 10, "amount": 100},
      {"description": "Widget B", "quantity": 5, "amount": 75}
    ]
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linked Records">
    Create a separate "Line Items" table and link records to invoices. Each line item becomes its own record.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
